## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This work did help me learn more in how to adjust a picture's color. As well as deal with some alignment issues I am currently having issues with.

All I had to do was adjust the background of the image container then mix it in.

EX:
```css
.Image-Container {
  Background: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
}

.Image{
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

### Continued development

Currently I am still having issues with alignment and how it adjusts with the webpage. As well trying to learn more in HTML and CSS before learning Javascript.
